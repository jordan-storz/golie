# GOLIE
## A visualizer application powered by Conway's Game of Life and enlivened with ColourLovers.com

### Wireframes

### Using the application
Golie Visual is available as a [Chrome extension.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/golie-visual/gjcgnoednebkdcnidoicdpfnenbbaphd)
Simply add the extension to your browser and your new tabs will display the application.  As far as controls go, you can change colors, change patterns, dim the background, and star your favorite combinations.  I will soon have a landing web page available to point to the extension and demonstrate the visualization.

### Contributing
While maintaining a elegant interface, Golie can definitely include additional features.  These are the features that I will implement shortly:
- Helpful hints to guide new users.
- A FAQ-style guide.
- A more robust favorites-interface (load a favorite on demand).

#### I am open to other advanced features and welcome pull requests.
